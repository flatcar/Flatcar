# Proposal: Automated Health Check System

## Overview
Implement an **Automated Health Check System** that regularly monitors the status of critical services and components within the project. This system would provide alerts and reports on the health of the system, helping maintainers and users quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Features
1. **Service Monitoring**
   - Monitor key services and components (e.g., APIs, databases, background jobs).
   - Check for uptime, response time, and error rates.

2. **Alerting System**
   - Send notifications via email, Slack, or other communication channels when a service is down or performance degrades.
   - Allow users to customize alert thresholds (e.g., response time exceeds a certain limit).

3. **Dashboard**
   - Create a web-based dashboard displaying the health status of all monitored services.
   - Include historical data and trends to help identify recurring issues.

4. **Integration with CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Integrate health checks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure services are healthy before deployment.

5. **Documentation and User Guide**
   - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and configure the health check system.
   - Include examples of common use cases and troubleshooting tips.

## Benefits
- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: By monitoring services continuously, issues can be identified and resolved before they affect users.
- **Improved Reliability**: Regular health checks enhance the overall reliability of the system.
- **User Confidence**: A visible health status dashboard can increase user confidence in the stability of the project.

## Next Steps
1. Gather feedback from the community on this proposal.
2. Create a detailed design document outlining the architecture and implementation plan.
3. Start developing the core components of the health check system.
